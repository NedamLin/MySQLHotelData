# MySQLHotelData
  The goal of this project was to clean and organize raw data by designing a second normal form (2NF) relational database using MySQL.
I structured the data into multiple normalized tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity, which also made querying more efficient.
  This project involved manually sorting and preparing the data before inserting it into the database, ensuring accuracy and consistency throughout.
  I wrote SQL queries using various JOIN operations to combine related data across tables, and applied aggregate functions (like COUNT and SUM) to generate meaningful insights from the data.
